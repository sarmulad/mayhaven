            Mayhaven Incubator is a sub of Mayhaven Innovation Hub. The Incubator supports 
            one of the many dreams of Mayhaven Innovation Hub - to power the creation of new market 
            innovation channels for entrepreneurs through quality business advisory, leadership management, 
            and capacity development training. Mayhaven Incubator is the first of its kind in the Ile-Ife 
            ecosystem. It started with 
            founders in the OAU ecosystem as it remains the most vibrant startup ecosystem in Nigeria.

              In an interview with the Founder of Mayhaven Innovation Hub, Elvis Kayode Idowu, the 
              inspiration and mission behind the Incubator was unraveled. Mayhaven Incubator started 
              as a quest to find a community that supports business startups with business advice, 
              co-working space and other opportunities.

            “The idea is to support founders at the early stage to win as fast as they can; and if 
            failure is inevitable, they fail fast enough to move on to something else in their journey 
             to success.”

              Mayhaven Incubator considers it a success when the startups release products into the 
              market whether they achieve full success or not. Get into the market to succeed or 
              restructure your failure.

               While highlighting some provisions of Mayhaven Incubator to the startup founders, 
               he noted that the Incubator aims to provide early stage startup founders advisory 
               support that gives them clarity when they are too in love with their products. 
               He expressed what Mayhaven Incubator can do for startup founders - find and foresee 
               the loopholes and opportunities they do not see as startup founders who get carried 
               away with their visions.
